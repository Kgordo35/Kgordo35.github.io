            <p class="intro">Cookies are text files that help store user information such as
                login credentials, a users shopping cart, or where they last left
                off on a website. Many times when there are new visitors to a website
                a prompt will display itslef to users to either accept, decline,
                or configure cookies. This is due to privacy concerns around the use
                of cookies as they collect user data seemingly unaware to the user.
                However not all cookies operate in the same way as there are different
                versions of cookies that can be running congruently on the same website
