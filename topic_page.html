            <p class="intro">	The use of cookies provides users with great convenience for managing past visits to websites. However, given the convenience of cookies, there are many concerns about how the data they gather is used. Many fear that the data being taken by cookies is being sold to others to steal personal information. This fear is justified, as that has happened in the past, and it is up to the user to determine if they feel that the website they have accessed is secure or not. The issue at hand is that most users either do not know how to check the security of a website, or they haven't been informed about the different types of cookies that are in use today. <br>
The first initial difference between cookies is whether they are first-party or third-party. First-party cookies are directly tied to the website that is being visited. These cookies typically store login information, remember what pages have been visited and completely read, or what the user has added to a shopping cart but has not completed the transaction. First-party cookies include User authentication, language preferences, sessions, site preferences, website analytics, online shopping carts, autofill forms, security, and accessibility. Third-party cookies include cross-site tracking, behavioral advertising, social media integration, affiliate marketing, customer profiling, retargeting, analytics, content personalization, and advertisement exchange.<br>
The first-party cookies aim to boost user experience on the website by creating a more streamlined experience on the website. The most common first-party cookies are user authentication and session cookies. It may seem like these cookies are built into your chosen browser; however, it is the website and server that store this data. User authentication and session cookies are so commonplace that many seem to forget that they are separate entities. The other first-party cookies, like language preference and accessibility cookies, almost tie together with user authentication in the way a website might keep a profile of a user.<br>
 The third-party cookies track information about users visiting a certain webpage, but they can follow users to other searches. The reason for this tracking is mostly for advertising purposes, but it has been used for more nefarious reasons, such as profiling and user grouping. Most often, third-party cookies are not directly tied to the website a user might be visiting, but to the advertisements that appear within the website. The seemingly most pervasive third-party cookies are persistent cookies. These are the cookies that can follow a user from website to website. These cookies will typically prompt a user when they first reach a website with a pop-up screen asking for permission to collect data on the user. After the user clicks accept, the persistent cookie is saved to the browser and monitors activity on different websites in an effort to push advertisements that the cookie believes a user would most likely interact with. There are two methods of getting rid of persistent cookies. Either the user has to manually delete the browser file in which the cookie is stored, or the persistent cookie will eventually time out, as they have expiration dates.<br>
Cookies are incredibly useful tools for web browsing as they provide great ease-of-use functionality to websites. Nevertheless, they can pose a threat to privacy as some monitor user behavior and attempt to build profiles of users and then group them to push advertisements they believe a user would interact with based on the personal information they have gathered. All cookies are inherently pervasive; however, that does not mean that they are all attempting to steal personal information to push advertisements. Some are genuinely helpful, while others are seen as parasitic. Therefore, the best way to combat nefarious third-party cookies is to stay informed on what each kind of cookie does, how to decline their requests for running, and how to remove them.
